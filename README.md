# freeCodeCamp_responsive_web_design_product_landing

--notes--  
-I don't have the right to any of the photos or icons used in the project and it was used jsut for demonstration purposes  
-This project was made for the freeCodeCamp certificate so some things might seem weird but it was just for the tasks to pass all of them  
-I didn't really care that much about class names since I was working alone :)  
-I didn't really give the media queries my best since I didn't have enough time to do better things  
-You will need to download the photos to see them or else you won't see them
